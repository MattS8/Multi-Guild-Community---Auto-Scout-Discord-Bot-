1: Fix bug where layer '1' shows as 'true' in some messages (endAllShifts?)
2: Add new command 'setLayerId()': sets the layer id for the given layer (Example: '!setId layer=2 44')
2: Add new feature that keeps track of all new messages on each boss layer. When the boss is reset due to cooldown expiration, it deletes all the messages to clear up the discord channels.
    - Must keep track of the # of messages on each channel and only bulkDelete() that amount! (stupid discord API)
